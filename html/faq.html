                  The method of selecting a king varies from krewe to krewe. Some krewes hold random drawings, while
                  others invite a celebrity guest to be their king. Rex, the King of Carnival, is chosen by the School
                  of Design, who sponsors the Rex parade. His identity is revealed the day before the parade.

                  Mardi Gras parade krewes are private, non-profit organizations whose members get together year round
                  to plan their parade's theme, costumes and unique throws. Each Carnival Club, as they are known, is
                  individually funded by its members. They support their krewe through dues, sales of krewe-related
                  merchandise to their members, and fundraising. Mardi Gras parade krewes sometimes have corporate
                  sponsors.

                  The city of New Orleans is not involved in coordinating Mardi Gras parades; their only involvement is
                  to issue parade permits to each individual Mardi Gras krewe that schedules and coordinates its own
                  parade.

                  The first Mardi Gras parade was held in New Orleans on Feb. 24, 1857 by the Krewe of Comus. They began
                  the tradition of presenting a parade with floats and following it with a ball for the krewe and their
                  guests.

                  The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day (Feast of the Epiphany). Mardi Gras
                  day (Fat Tuesday), however, is on a different day each year.

                  Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat
                  Tuesday is always the day before Ash Wednesday.

                  Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and stay through Ash
                  Wednesday. Check out our dates page to see when Fat Tuesday will fall through the next few years.

                  The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very warm, almost hot. Sometimes it will
                  change from one extreme to the other during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer your clothes since
                  a chilly morning may turn into a warm afternoon.

                  Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that can get somewhat
                  dirty. Don’t forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then you’ll definitely
                  want to bring a raincoat!

              <div class="accordion__content">
                <p>By all means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a family celebration. Those of us who
                  grew up in New Orleans feel guilty once our children have grown up and we continue going to every
                  parade because we used to use "taking the children" as our excuse! Bring big bags (even large garbage
                  bags!) to hold all of the stuff they will catch. Throws often include toys, stuffed animals, beads,
                  and more.

                  The only place you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter (where no full-size parades pass
                  anyway). We recommend seeing the parades when they begin on St. Charles Avenue near Napoleon since
                  parades can last until 11 p.m. near the end of the route. The Garden District portion of St. Charles
                  is a family area where you will see many families staking out their parade watching position, having
                  picnics, playing ball, and having fun under the beautiful oak trees. You don't have to worry about the
                  streetcars, as they stop running in this area during Mardi Gras.

                  You may also want to consider taking your kids to the parades in suburban areas like Metairie, which
                  is only 10 minutes away from New Orleans. Metairie's Caesar parade, the Saturday before Mardi Gras
                  weekend, is the parade Disneyworld features on Mardi Gras day. Kids love it!</p>
